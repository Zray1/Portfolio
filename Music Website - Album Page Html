        <p class="musictext"> Commencement the EP is a collab project with my cousin K Coolie who executive produced the entire EP. When we first got the idea of dropping this EP on our college graduation weekend, we wanted to go for a laid back,
          smooth project full of melodic vibes. The EP opens up with "College" encouraging listeners to stay locked in and remain focused! Balancing music and school for both me and my cousin was a challenege but we stayed focused, made hits, and
          went
          to college, now we have our degrees and a fire a** EP! The song "Today" is actually a combination of two songs I wrote to this beat and after I rap about everything I set out to do and get done on this particular day I had to add my own
          unique switch up and went into a catchy tune boasting how I'm constantly on a new wave and I always need change. <br><br>The Combination of "Roll It" Ft. Moozy G and "Live and learn" first adds a soothing touch to something I love to do and
          then counters it with a song that is constant reminder to myself that it is ok to make mistakes and I am always living and learning. In "Live and Learn" I used different tones in my voice to represent the up and downs we experience in life.
          At first I was rapping and I wanted my thoughts to be doing the adlibs/rapping in the background the entire song cause its a constant battle in my head so why not? The song is assembled in phases (like life) with each verse gradually
          changing
          and building till the ending where I freestyle jokingly showing that i'm still messing up and still have room to Live and Learn. Me and K Coolie enlisted the help of Zach Outro (Singing Z.J.) on the songs "Do You" and "Climate Change" where
          we reflect on not only experiences in life up until this point but encouraging myself and people listening to be themselves, stand out, and most of all make a positive change in others lives. Click on your Favorite streaming platform below

        <p class="musictext"> Part 1 of a bigger picture, Grind & Dream is more than a project, it is a way of life I have come to live by. Grind & Dream Vol. 1 is a collection of 8 songs expressing my grind and determination to chase my dreams and
          achieve my goals. Vol. 1 is titled motivate for that exact purpose, to motivate anyone listening to grind for their dreams no matter how hard the journey may be and regardless of any obstacles in your way. This project is a combination of
          songs recorded back in April of 2018 through December 2018 and each song represents part of the "Grind" mindset I instilled in myself. <br><br>This is my first solo project that means more to me than I can put into words. K Coolie and Crypt
          each produced 4 songs on this project and Noah Boat is featured on the songs "Level Up" and "Take A Seat". My personal favorite's are "Can't Sleep (M.O.D.)" and "Kickin It", both recorded at a time when my confidence and mindset where in a
          bad space. You can hear my passion and desperation to be successful through the lyrics and these songs can make anyone want to get up off their a** and hustle! Click on your Favorite streaming platform below and listen to Grind & Dream Vol.

        <p class="musictext"> Ride the Wave EP is a collaboration project with Noah Boat. This project is executive produced by Crypt and cooked up by Lil Edd. Until this point me and Noah were just rapping for fun and were known more for our parody
          rap songs like "Peter Piper", "Pills", and "Crocs". On this 6 song EP we decided to take rap a little more serious while still adding our own fun parody rap flavor in songs like "Sauce" where we both spit bars all having to do with sauces
          and
          condiments used for food. With songs like "Surfs Up" "Call of Duty", and "Speed Limit" me and Noah showed our versatility and ability to rap over a variety of beats all while making catchy parodic references. Click on your Favorite
